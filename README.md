## Background

This R package enables the user to create soundscapes of 2-dimensional data. As well as hopefully contributing to the wider field of data sonification, the package can be particularly useful to data scientists and statisticians who are blind. The code was originally written by [Stefan Siegert,](https://github.com/sieste) with feedback and ideas from [Robin Williams.](https://github.com/rmwilliams/2023)

## Installation

The current release can be installed from CRAN using
```
install.package("sonify")
```
and then loaded in to an R session with
```
library(sonify)
```

The package can also be installed from this repo using the devtools package.
