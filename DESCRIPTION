Title: Data Sonification - Turning Data into Sound
Description: Sonification (or audification) is the process of representing data by sounds in the audible range. This package provides the R function sonify() that transforms univariate data, sampled at regular or irregular intervals, into a continuous sound with time-varying frequency. The ups and downs in frequency represent the ups and downs in the data. Sonify provides a substitute for R's plot function to simplify data analysis for the visually impaired.
